1. Install NodeJS.

2. Open Terminal in VSCode and type "npm create vite@latest" then do setup.
We will use "MyFirstReactWebsite" as project name.

3. Run:
    cd MyFirstReactWebsite
    npm Install
    npm run dev

You will see the link for your website. In my case, it's "http://localhost:5173/".
Congratulations, this is your first ReactJS website.
